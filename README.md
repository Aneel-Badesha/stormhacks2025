# Tapply: Tap, Earn, Repeat

## Executive Summary
Small merchants still rely on physical loyalty artifacts (punch cards, stamp cards, plastic rewards cards). Those artifacts are fragile, untrackable, and give merchants no analytics — while large brands run digital programs that measurably increase revenue.

We will build a unified digital loyalty platform that replaces all traditional punch/stamp/rewards cards with a single mobile + web product: customers tap an NFC tag to collect a stamp or points, merchants manage programs in a simple admin panel, and both sides benefit from better tracking, anti-fraud, and measurable ROI.

## Problem Statement
Physical loyalty systems are failing small businesses:

- Paper/punch cards and plastic rewards cards are easy to lose, easy to game, and provide zero analytics.  
- Small merchants can’t afford or don’t have the expertise for complex loyalty SaaS used by big retailers.  
- Fragmented customer experiences (many physical cards, many programs) reduce engagement and adoption.  
- Merchants lack simple, affordable tools to measure program ROI or re-engage customers efficiently.

## Opportunity
Replace the entire physical loyalty stack (punch cards, stamp cards, plastic cards) with one digital platform that:

- Supports multiple reward formats (stamp/punch, points, single-reward cards).  
- Uses NFC tap (native mobile) + QR fallback for universal coverage.  
- Gives merchants a no-code admin panel for campaign creation, analytics, and re-engagement.  
- Is low-cost, privacy-conscious, and fraud-resistant.
