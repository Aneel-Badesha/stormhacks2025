## Executive Summary

Small merchants still rely on physical loyalty artifacts (punch cards, stamp cards, plastic rewards cards). Those artifacts are fragile, untrackable, and give merchants no analytics â€” while large brands run digital programs that measurably increase revenue.

**Punchly** is a unified digital loyalty platform that replaces all traditional punch/stamp/rewards cards with a single mobile + web product: customers tap an NFC tag to collect stamps or points, merchants manage programs in a simple admin panel, and both sides benefit from better tracking, anti-fraud, and measurable ROI.

## The Problem

Physical loyalty systems are failing small businesses:

- Paper/punch cards and plastic rewards cards are easy to lose, easy to game, and provide zero analytics
- Small merchants can't afford or don't have the expertise for complex loyalty SaaS used by big retailers
- Fragmented customer experiences (many physical cards, many programs) reduce engagement and adoption
- Merchants lack simple, affordable tools to measure program ROI or re-engage customers efficiently

## Our Solution

- Multiple reward formats - Stamp/punch cards, points systems, single-reward programs
- NFC tap - Native mobile scanning with QR fallback for universal coverage
- No-code admin panel - Campaign creation, analytics, and customer re-engagement
- Low-cost & secure - Privacy-conscious, fraud-resistant architecture
